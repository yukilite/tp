## 1. Introduction

This document serves as a user guide for HAMS. It teaches the user how to install HAMS, describes the features of HAMS, 
explains how HAMS can be used and finally answer some frequently asked questions about HAMS.
 
HAMS is a CLI-based medical facility administration system that assists in the maintenance of various medical records. 

HAMS is designed for administrative assistants in medical facilities, like hospitals or polyclinics, that *prefer using
CLI to keep track of various medical records* and *can type fast*.

***
    
### 1.1 Starting HAMS
1. Ensure you have JDK 11 installed on your computer. You can download the installer for your OS from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
2. Download the latest .jar file release for HAMS from [GitHub](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113T-T13-3/tp/releases).
3. Move the .jar to an empty folder.
4. Open Command Prompt.
5. In Command Prompt, change your current working directory to the folder containing the .jar using $ `cd <Path of folder containing .jar>`
6. Run the .jar using $ `java -jar (latest version).jar`

## 2. Features

#### Keep track of different record types
HAMS provides you with an easy-to-use system that helps manage and keep track of two types of medical records: *Patients* and *Appointments*.

#### View all your tasks
The `lista` or `listp` command that HAMS provides can display all the Appointment or Patient records within the system in a readable format.

#### Auto-save and store these records
HAMS has an auto-save feature which stores Patient and Appointments every time you add or modify them. 
With this feature, your tasks will be saved every time you leave the application and can be easily retrieved when you reopen the application subsequently.

## 3. Command Format

Words enclosed within angle brackets `[]` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. Other keywords stated are compulsory and they should be included.

For example, in `adda \date [date] \time [time] \pid [patient id]`, `adda` is the command keyword that adds an Appointment record. 

`\date` and `\time` are compulsory labels to denoting what field the subsequent information belongs to.
`[date]` is the date of the appointment to be supplied by you. `[time]` represents the time of the appointment to be supplied by you.

A valid input would be `adda \date 22/05/2020 \time 1200 \pid 1`.

## 6. FAQ
**Q**: Would my details be captured if I randomize the input order of the keywords?

* `addp \phone 12345678 \address NUS \age 22 \name John Doe`
* `addp \name John Doe \address NUS \ age 22 \ phone 12345678`

**A**: Yes. The system is keyword-sensitive. Regardless of the order given, it stores the information within each command used respectively. Both examples provided above would result in the same information stored. 

**Q**: Why does my patient list does not display any value in the age field?

* `{[Name]: Tommy | [Age]:  | [Address]:  | [Contact Number]: 92331234}`

**A**: The age supplied might not be in the correct format (eg age given is a negative number or as a string).

**Q**: Why am I not able to find anything using finda or findp? 

**A**: Please note that all search values are case-sensitive. For example, `Sam` will not match with `sam`
because of the first letter capitalization. 

**Q**: What is `pid` for in the command `adda`?

**A**: `pid` stands for Patient ID, it is a unique ID tag to each patient. In order to link appointments 
to the patient, the pid tag must be present. 

**Q**: I accidentally put in the wrong Patient ID when adding an appointment using `adda`. How can I change the patientID?

**A**: Unfortunately upon entering the Patient ID in `adda`, there is no way of changing the Patient ID. Please remove the incorrect appointment and add the correct appointment in again.
